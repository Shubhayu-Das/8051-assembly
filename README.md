# 8051-assembly
-----------------------------

This repo documents all the code that I wrote for the 8051 microcontroller.
Here are a list of the code files, along with a short description:
1. chess_clock_time.asm - Implements a digital chess clock. Utilizes interrupts and timers, along with some GPIO pin
   manipulations. The 8051 MCU interacts with a Hitachi HD44780 display driver to control a 16x2 LCD monochrome display.
