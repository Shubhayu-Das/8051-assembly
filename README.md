# 8051-assembly
-----------------------------

\[update from the last commit\]
This repo ended up being a source for this particular project only. This project is exponentially more complex, compared to the other things in the course(and even this isn't particularly complex).

Files in the repo

```bash
$ tree
.
├── chess_clock_demo.mp4 # Demo video
├── chess_clock_time.asm # The actual code
└── README.md
```

I am not documenting anything here, because there are comments in the assembly file. However, while reading this over an year later, some things feel alien. So I will work on improving this aspect of the program.
